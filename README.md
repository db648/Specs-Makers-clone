## OUR CHALLENGES :
We faced a lots of challenges while completing this project, The major problem was that we were working remotely so, communication and time management was major issue between us. As the project had short span of deadline so, on the last two days we all were working the whole night to complete our user-friendly website.
- Making Responsive Website and adding java script features
- Sliding images, adding hem-burger functionality to navbar
- Creating own data which required for website
- while merging code and commit data to repository

We all are SOLVED our challenges as a team with good team spirit and finally cloned the website.
